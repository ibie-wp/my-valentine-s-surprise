# 💝 Valentine's Day Microsite for Your Girlfriend

A personal, warm, and playful single-page microsite that scrolls through a thoughtful flow — asking her to be your Valentine.

---

## 1. Landing Screen
- Her name displayed large and beautifully centered
- A calm, intentional sentence underneath explaining why you made this
- Soft animated gradient background in warm pink/rose/peach tones
- Subtle floating heart particles for ambiance
- A "scroll down" or arrow indicator to begin the journey

## 2. Memory & Warmth Section
- 3–5 photo/video placeholders in a clean vertical or staggered layout
- Each with a short, personal caption (e.g., "Remember this day? We laughed so hard 😄")
- Gentle fade-in animations as you scroll into view
- Placeholders will have clear labels like `[Replace with photo #1]` so you know exactly where to drop in your media

## 3. Light Humor Section
- Jokey text about being broke and not seeing each other Saturday
- Frames the picnic + painting date as a sweet promise
- Maybe a fun gif placeholder spot (e.g., a silly reaction gif)
- Playful typography and emoji use

## 4. Subtle Acknowledgment
- One clean, mature line about caring deeply — styled simply and elegantly, set apart from the rest

## 5. The Valentine's Ask 💌
- Big, beautiful "Will you be my Valentine?" question
- Three positive buttons: **Yes** / **Absolutely** / **Can't wait**
- One **No** button that triggers a playful popup:
  - Shows a joke like "Oh no… are you mad at me? 😅" or "Oh, so you hate my soul? 😂"
  - Then a soft nudge: "Kidding 😌… but seriously, I hope you'll say yes"
  - The "No" button playfully dodges the cursor on hover (moves away) for extra fun

## 6. After-Yes Celebration Screen
- Confetti/hearts animation bursts on screen
- Sweet closing message about the future picnic + painting date
- A warm sign-off line that makes her feel chosen and loved
- Optional: a final gif/image placeholder for something cute

## 7. Design & Vibe
- **Color palette**: Soft pinks, warm peach, rose gold accents, cream backgrounds
- **Typography**: Rounded, friendly font feel using the existing system
- **Animations**: Fade-ins on scroll, floating hearts on landing, confetti on "Yes", hover effects on buttons
- **Layout**: Single-page vertical scroll, generous whitespace, nothing cluttered
- **Mobile-first**: Will look great on her phone
